  Returns an array of key-value pairs for the provided input object.
  Each pair is a 2-item array with the first item being the key and
  the second item being the value.
  This function is the inversed of the `from_items()` function.

  Note that because JSON hashes are inheritently unordered,
  the key value pairs of the provided object $obj are inheritently unordered.
  Implementations are not required to return values in any specific order.
examples:
  basic:
    context: {"a": "first", "b": "second"}
    args: ['@']
    returns: [["a", "first"], ["b", "second"]]
