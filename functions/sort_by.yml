  Sort an array using an expression `expr` as the sort key.  For each element
  in the array of `elements`, the `expr` expression is applied and the
  resulting value is used as the key used when sorting the `elements`.
  
  If the result of evaluating the `expr` against the current array element
  results in type other than a `number` or a `string`, a type error will
  occur.
  
  Below are several examples using the `people` array (defined above) as the
  given input.  `sort_by` follows the same sorting logic as the `sort`
  function.
examples:
- context: None
  args: [people, &age]
  returns: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- context: None
  args: [people, &age]
  returns: {"age": 10, "age_str": "10", "bool": true, "name": 3}
- context: None
  args: [people, &to_number(age_str)]
  returns: {"age": 10, "age_str": "10", "bool": true, "name": 3}
