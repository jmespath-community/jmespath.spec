  Captures the current evaluation context in a child lexical scope.

  When the expression referred to by its second argument is evaluated,
  identifiers are looked up first in the current evaluation context, 
  and then in the hierarchy of lexical scopes, until a value is found.

      search_for: foo
      people: [name: a, name: b, name: c, name: foo, name: bar, name: baz, name: qux,
        name: x, name: y, name: z]
    args: ['{search_for: search_for}', '&people[?name==search_for].name | [0]']
    returns: foo
